# @devvit/web-view-scripts

Intended for use exclusively in web view apps for code that is shipped on CDN or planned to be shipped on CDN. The mechanism works by injecting a script tag into any HTML files at web view asset upload time:

```html
<script src="https://webview.devvit.net/scripts/devvit.v1.min.js?clientVersion=1.2.3"></script>
```

This code is not bundled with an app. It's always downloaded (or planned to be downloaded).

The entire dist/scripts directory is uploaded on merge.

## Development

See [tools/wvs.html](wvs.html).
